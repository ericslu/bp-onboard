## LA Blueprint Developer Onboarding Project 2024
Created by: James, Siddharth
This project is built on React Native Expo intended to teach new developers and returning developers important skills in order to prepare them for their project teams.

### Setup:
1)
Clone the repo to your local setup to build off your starter code. You should be able to then remove the remote git connection and create your own repo to save your progress.
```
git clone https://github.com/lablueprint/dev-onboarding-2023.git
```

2)
Once you have setup your new repo, install the necessary modules to run the application. Make sure that you are in the main repo directory in your terminal and type the following command:
```
npm install
```
This is essential to do every time you pull new changes made from other teammates as well.

3)
To run the application, make sure you are in your main repo directory and type the following command in your terminal:
```
npx expo start
```
Make sure you have the Expo Go app downloaded on your mobile device. You can also use an emulator on your laptop if you prefer. Once it is on your mobile device, open up your camera (IOS) or the app camera (Android) and scan the QR code to see the application build.
